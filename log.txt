@kbohls @max_olson The Man in the High Castle is really good if you have Amazon Prime! Season 2 just got released last month

@Espngreeny who have they played though? Most impressive win during this streak was against Seattle. None of those teams have good offenses

O.J. Howard wide open for a TD?? Hmmmm sounds familiar ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

RT @Big12Refs: Did the replay take awhile? Yes.
Did we get it right? Probably not.
Did you notice our arms? We know you did.

@craigway1 I miss DT! It feels like it's been a while since Texas has had a solid, reliable TE

OH NO!! The refs are from the Big XII...why @NCAAFootball whhyyyyy

@MikeAndMike is the Green Mamba capable of taking flight?

@CodyPhillipsUT before the game last week I thought it was Bama's for the taking but after the osu game I have a lot more faith in Clemson

@Likenyo psssssh wait till we get out of class #HTownTakeover
